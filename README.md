# customAnime

## this one is based on [ktaebum](https://github.com/ktaebum)'s job,you can view it from [here](https://github.com/ktaebum/AttentionedDeepPaint)

this one is a temp project that provide a trained model of deepunet for painting the sketch.

in this web model you can just download the model from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J9o8uFBAkTpagBOLJc5jApFFWg-gyWLz)

## how to use?

1. download the model and put it into checkpoint folder
2. python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
3. open 127.0.0.1:8000 in your explorer(I think all explorer is okay)
4. choose four color and upload a sketch(you can find some sketch by google sketch,there are also some test files in ./media)
5. now you get the painted one



## problems exist
1. 4 color is not enough,in fact,this program can get 20 color.but I don't have enough time design the front page.
2. even you provide 4 color,some part of the sketch didn't follow these four color.we have to assume this is because the model
3. not beautiful at all,like i said, this is just a temp project.
4. the requirment of sketch is very high,basicly it should be 'clean'(which means no grey area just lines)
5. the name of the img you upload should not contain any strange charcters(like"(\)),this can be solved but maybe later when i have some time
